# Custom Elements

## Autoloading

For ease of use the starter provides automagic imports of Custom Elements. This works with vue based Custom Elements and normal Custom Elements. Additionally they are also registered in the Custom Element Registry.
The Tagname is composed of a prefix and the filename. The default value for the prefix is the name of the
theme. The prefix can be changed in the config.
```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import uebertool from '@ueberbit/vite-plugin-drupal'

export default defineConfig(async () => {
  return {
    plugins: [
      uebertool({
        ce: {
          prefix: 'foo'
        }
      }),
    ],
  }
})
```

There are several options to choose from:

### eager
filename: `**.eager.ce.(tsx?|jsx?|vue)`

behavior: Components are imported in your main file.

usage: Use when the Custom Element is important and should be there as soon as possible.


### lazy
filename: `**.lazy.ce.(tsx?|jsx?|vue)`

behavior: Components are lazily imported in your main file.

usage: Use when the Custom Element is important and should be there as rather quickly.


### idle
filename: `**.idle.ce.(tsx?|jsx?|vue)`

behavior: Components are lazily imported in your main file, when the browser is idling.

usage: Use when the Custom Element should load when the initial load of the page is done.


### visible
filename: `**.visible.ce.(tsx?|jsx?|vue)`

behavior: Components are lazily imported in your main file, when they approach the viewport.

usage: Use when the Custom Element should only load when necessary.

## Styling
In vue based Custom Elements the tailwindcss Stylesheet is automagically injected.


## Example

`templates/components/button/button.visible.ce.vue`:
```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
const text = `I'm a Vue custom element! I get mounted when I approach the viewport.`
</script>

<template>
  <!-- Tailwind works -->
  <button class="text-red-400 btn">{{ text }}</button>
</template>

<style>
// importing component styles works!
@import './button.css';
</style>

```

`templates/components/button/button.html.twig`:
```twig
<{prefix}-button></{prefix}-button>
```
