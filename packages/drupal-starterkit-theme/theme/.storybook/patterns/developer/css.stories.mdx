## PostCSS

The Starter provides default configuration for postcss. The default config is only used if no `postcss.config.js` file is present inside the theme directory.
The default config looks like this:

```js
plugins: [
  require('postcss-import')(),
  require('tailwindcss/nesting')(),
  require('tailwindcss')(),
  require('autoprefixer')(),
]
```

If you want to provide your own config, you can create a `postcss.config.js` file inside the theme.

## Cascade Layers
The Starter makes use of css cascade layers. Aggregated styles from drupal are wrapped in the drupal layer. This allows very easy overriding of drupal styles.

Tailwind layers are wrapped in the tailwind-base, tailwind-components and tailwind-utilities layers.

The ordering of layers looks like this:
```css
@layer tailwind-base, drupal, tailwind-components, tailwind-utilities;
```
